## Algorithm Challenge
You need either Dart or Node installed.

The script was written originally in Dart. The `main.dart` file contains comments and a structured code. Also, this version is console interactive, allowing you to input the arrays and see the result. To run: `dart main.dart`

The JS version was generated through dart2js, and the dart:io library fails. So it uses the same inputs of the reference and shows the result on the console. To run: `node test.js`
